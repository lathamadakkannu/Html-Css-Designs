        A birthday cake is a cake eaten as part of a birthday celebration.
        While there is no standard for birthday cakes, they are typically highly decorated layers.
        The first actual birthday cake was for children's birthdays in Germany in the Middle Ages, called Kinderfest. 
        Each year, the child would receive a cake and one candle for every year of their life, plus one extra to symbolize the upcoming year.
